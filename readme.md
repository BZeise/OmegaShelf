Omega Shelf is a fun single page web application to keep track of the things on the Omega cohort shelf.

Omega Shelf uses:
* Angularjs
* MongoDB
* Node.js
* Express
* Bcrypt
* SweetAlerts
* JQuery?

All visitors to the site can see the shelf's contents.  Users can create accounts and log in.  Once a user is logged in they can 'put' (post) things on the shelf.  Users can delete content they have added but not that of others.

This app includes sound effects recorded by the authors of this app.
